# google maps svelte project

Project trying out combining [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) with [Svelte.dev](https://svelte.dev/) and data from [digitraffic](https://meri.digitraffic.fi/swagger).
To get a working environment you will need to replace GOOGLE_API_KEY in [app.html](/src/app.html) with your own Google API key.

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
